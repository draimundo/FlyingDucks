# FlyingDucks
## Abstract
Repository for team Flying Ducks at the 2019 Call for Code at ETH Zurich

Our project aims to alleviate the following problematics encountered in the deployment of [Project Owl](http://www.project-owl.com/):
- Heavy human involvement needed for placement;
- Accessibility of the zone;
- Connectivity in urban/accidented areas.

Additionally the system can provide:
- Supplementary information about civilian locations, by adding a small hardware/software GSM detection component to the network.
- Live monitoring capabilities (air temperature, oxygen concentration, water level, etc) using additional sensors, which could be used to anticipate the extension of the disaster.

## Files
The main files constituting the submission are the following:
- [short report]()
- [flow json]() which requires:
  - [node-red-dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard);
  - [https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap).
  
The flow is also started on an [open node-red cloud link](https://flyingducks.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/red/), for quick review and test.
